Here are some resources


## General Coding 
Bioinformatics of any kind will require some base knowledge of coding. Here are some resources for common tools.

A [statistics focused introduction](https://stat545.com/) to R

A guide for [python](https://pythonforbiologists.com/)

## Single-Cell Transcriptomics Specific
Coding in R, I would recommend starting with [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/get_started_v5_new) as the tutorials are very good. 

Coding in python, [scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is also excellent with great tutorials. 

## Courses and workshops
[Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops](https://bioinformatics.ca/workshops/current-workshops/)

Applications currently open for [Single Cell RNA-seq Analysis](https://bioinformatics.ca/workshops-all/2024-single-cell-rna-seq-analysis/)
