Looking to learn scRNAseq analysis or another bioinformatic analysis? Here are some places to get started!


## General Coding 
Bioinformatics, of any kind, will require some base knowledge of coding. Here are some resources for commonly used tools. 

<img alt="alt_text" width="40px" src="images/rstudio_94807.png" /> An introduction to [R](https://stat545.com/) with focus on statistics

<img alt="alt_text" width="40px" src="images/python.jpeg" />  A guide for [python](https://pythonforbiologists.com/)

<img alt="alt_text" width="40px" src="images/command-line.jpg" /> An introduction to [Command line](http://korflab.ucdavis.edu/bootcamp.html)

## Single-Cell Transcriptomics Specific

<img alt="alt_text" width="40px" src="images/SeuratV5.png" /> If your preference is coding in R, I would recommend starting with [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/get_started_v5_new) as the tutorials are very good.

## Courses and Workshops
<img alt="alt_text" width="40px" src="images/logo-canadian-bioinformatics-workshops.png" /> [Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops](https://bioinformatics.ca/workshops/current-workshops/) are available on a variety of topics with one course specifically on single-cell transcriptomics

<img alt="alt_text" width="40px" src="images/CBW_sc-rna-seq.jpg" /> Applications currently open for [Single Cell RNA-seq Analysis](https://bioinformatics.ca/workshops-all/2024-single-cell-rna-seq-analysis/)
